Mr. Podger always particularly enjoyed the last night of each summer at Loon Lake . The narrow fringe of sadness that ran around it only emphasized the pleasure . The evening was not always spent in the same way . This year , on a night cool with the front of September moving in , but with plenty of summer still about , the Podgers were holding a neighborhood gathering in the Pod . The little cottage was bursting with people of all ages . In the midst of it all , Mr. Podger came out on the Pod porch , alone . He had that day attended a country auction , and he had come back with a prize . The prize was an old-fashioned , woven cloth hammock , complete with cross-top pillow , fringed side pieces , and hooks for hanging . Mrs. Podger had obligingly pushed things around on the porch to make room for it , and there it was , slung in a vine-shaded corner , the night breeze rippling its fringe with a slow , caressing movement . Mr. Podger sat down in it , pushed himself back and forth in one or two slow , rhythmic motions , and then swung his feet up into it . He closed his eyes and let the unintelligible drift of voices sweep pleasantly over him . Suddenly one young voice rose above the others . `` But '' , it said , `` do you always know when you're happy '' ? ? The voice sank back into the general tangle of sound , but the question stayed in Mr. Podger's mind . Here , in the cool , autumn-touched evening , Mr. Podger mentally retraced a day that had left him greatly contented and at peace . It had begun with the blue jay feather . Walking along the lake before breakfast , Mr. Podger had seen the feather , and the bird that had lost it in flight . The winging spread of blue had gone on , calling harshly , into the wood . The small shaft of blue had drifted down and come to rest at his feet . All day long Mr. Podger , who was a straw-hat man in the summer , had worn the feather in the band of his broad-brimmed sunshield . Would a blue feather in a man's hat make him happy all day ? ? Hardly . But it was something to have seen it floating down through the early morning sunshine , linking the blue of the sky with the blue of the asters by the lake . Then , since the auction was being held nearby , he had walked to it . And there , on the way , had been the box turtle , that slow , self-contained , world-ignoring relic of pre-history , bent , for reasons best known to itself , on crossing the road . It was doing very well , too , having reached the center , and was pursuing its way with commendable singleness of purpose when Mr. Podger saw hazard approaching in the shape of a flashy little sports car . Would the driver see the turtle ? ? Would he take pains to avoid it ? ? Mr. Podger took no chances . Taking off his hat and signaling the driver with it , Mr. Podger stepped into the road , lifted the surprised turtle and consummated its road-crossing with what must have been a breath-taking suddenness . The turtle immediately withdrew into its private council room to study the phenomenon . But Mr. Podger and the driver of the sports car waved at each other . Here in the cool darkness Mr. Podger could still feel the warmth of midday , could still see the yellow butterflies dancing over the road , could still see the friendly grin on the young , sun-browned face as the driver looked back over his shoulder for a moment before the car streaked out of sight . Where was the driver now ? ? What was he doing ? ? And the turtle ? ? Mr. Podger smiled . For a few brief minutes they had all been part of one little drama . The three would never meet again , but for some reason or other Mr. Podger was sure he would always remember the incident . Then there had been the auction itself . Mr. Podger heard again ; ; at will , the voice of the auctioneer , the voices of the bidders , and finally the small boy who had been so interested in Mr. Podger's hammock purchase . `` I like them things , too '' , he had said . `` We got one at home . You know what ? ? If you're lyin' out in the hammock at night , and it gets kinda cool -- you know -- you just take these sides with the fringe on -- see -- and wrap 'em right over you . I do it , lots o' times -- I like to lie in a hammock at night , by myself , when it's all quiet . The wind moves it a little bit -- you know . '' Mr. Podger had thanked him gravely , and now he made use of the advice . As he pulled the fringed sides up and made himself into a cocoon , Mr. Podger saw that thin , attractive , freckled little face again , and hoped that the boy , too , was lying in a cool , fringed-wrapped quiet . Alacrity , the Podger cat , came by the hammock , rubbed her back briefly against it , and then , sure of a welcome , hopped up . She remarked that she found the night wind a little chilly , and Mr. Podger took her inside the fringe . Soon her purring rivaled the chirping of the tree crickets , rivaled the hum of voices from inside the Pod . Mr. Podger was just adding this to his pictures of the day when the screen door opened and Pam burst out . `` Dad '' ! ! She said . `` It's getting so chilly we've lighted a fire , and we're going to tell a round robin story -- a nice , scary one . We need you to start it . Why are you out here all by yourself ? ? Aren't you happy '' ? ? Mr. Podger opened his cocoon and emerged , tucking Alacrity under his arm to bring her in by the fire . `` Of course I am '' , he said . `` Never happier in my life . I just came out here to know it '' . Dallas As the South begins another school year , national and even world attention is directed at the region's slow progress toward racial equality in the public schools . Desegregation is beginning in two more important Southern cities -- Dallas and Atlanta . In each city civic and education leaders have been working hard to get public opinion prepared to accept the inevitability of equal treatment . These programs emphasize the acceptance of biracial classrooms peacefully . The programs do not take sides on the issue itself . They point out simply that `` it is the law of the land '' . The two cities have the examples of Little Rock and New Orleans to hold up as warnings against resorting to violence to try to stop the processes of desegregation . Even better , they have the examples of Nashville and Houston to hold up as peaceful and progressive programs . In each case there was an initial act of violence . In Nashville , a school was dynamited . In Houston , there were a few incidents of friction between whites and Negroes , none of which were serious . In each city quick public reaction and fast action by the city government halted the threats of more serious incidents . The Nashville plan , incidentally , has become recognized as perhaps the most acceptable and thus the most practical to put into effect in the troubled South . It is a `` stair-step '' plan , in which desegregation begins in the first grade . Each year another grade is added to the process , until finally all 12 grades are integrated . The schedules are flexible so that the program can be accelerated as the public becomes more tolerant or realizes that it is something that has to be done , `` so why not now '' . The program has worked well in both Nashville and Houston . It met a serious rebuff in New Orleans , where the two schools selected for the first moves toward integration were boycotted by white parents . Another attempt will be made this year in New Orleans to resume the program . Generally , throughout the South , there is a growing impatience with the pattern of violence with which every step of desegregation is met . Perhaps the most eloquent move toward removal of racial barriers has been in Dallas . During the summer , Negroes began quietly patronizing previously segregated restaurants and lunch counters in downtown retail establishments . It was part of a citywide move toward full integration . So successful has been this program , worked out by white and Negro civic leaders , that further extensions are expected in the next few months . Hotels , for example , are ready to let down the bars . Already , at least one hotel has been quietly taking reservations on a nonracial basis . Several conventions have been held in recent months in hotels on a nonsegregated basis . This is a radical change in attitude from the conditions which prevailed several years ago , when a series of bombings was directed against Negroes who were moving into previously all-white neighborhoods of Dallas . It is also symptomatic of a change in attitude which appears to be spreading all across the South . Southern whites themselves are realizing that they had been wrong in using violence to try to stop Negroes from claiming equal rights . They insist they are ashamed of such violence and intimidation as occurred in Alabama when the Freedom Riders sought to break down racial discrimination in local bus depots . All across the South there are signs that racial violence is finding less approval among whites who themselves would never take active part but might once have shown a tolerant attitude toward it . There are many causes for this change . One of the most important is economic . Business leaders are aware now that they suffer greatly from any outbreak of violence . They are putting strong pressure on their police departments to keep order . In the past these same Southerners were inclined to look the other way . And as the businessmen have begun to act , a real sense of co-operation has sprung up . This co-operation has emboldened other Southern whites to add their voices to demands for peaceable accommodation . They realize that by acting in concert , rather than individually , they will not be picked out as objects of retaliation -- economic and otherwise . Since moving from a Chicago suburb to Southern California a few months ago , I've been introduced to a new game called Lanesmanship . Played mostly on the freeways around Los Angeles , it goes like this : A driver cruising easily at 70 m.p.h. in Lane A of a four-lane freeway spies an incipient traffic jam ahead . Traffic in the next lane appears to be moving more smoothly so he pokes a tentative fender into Lane B , which is heavily populated by cars also moving at 70 m.p.h. . The adjacent driver in Lane B has three choices open to him . He can ( 1 ) point his car resolutely at the invading fender and force the other driver back into Lane A ; ; ( 2 ) slow down and permit the ambivalent driver to change lanes ; ; or ( 3 ) alternately accelerate and decelerate , thus keeping the first driver guessing as to his intentions , thereby making a fascinating sport of the whole affair . The really remarkable thing to me is that most California natives unhesitatingly elect to slow down and permit the invading car free access . Whether or not this is done out of enlightened self-preservation , I don't know . But it is done , consistently and I'm both surprised and impressed . This could never happen in my native Chicago . There such soggy acquiesence would be looked upon as a sure sign of deteriorating manhood . In Chicago , the driver cut out would likely jam his gas pedal to the floor in an effort to force the other car back . Failing this , he would pull alongside at the first opportunity and shake his fist threateningly . This negative explanation of courtesy on the freeways , however , does an injustice to Southern California drivers . At the risk of losing my charge-a-plate at Marshall Field and Company , I would like to challenge an old and hallowed stereotype . After three months of research , I can state unequivocally that Los Angeles drivers are considerably more courteous and competent than any other drivers I've ever encountered . During one recent day of driving about Los Angeles there were actually a dozen occasions when oncoming drivers stopped an entire lane of traffic to permit me to pull out of an impossible side street .
