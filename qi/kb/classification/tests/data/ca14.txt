Philadelphia , Jan. 23 -- Nick Skorich , the line coach for the football champion Philadelphia Eagles , was elevated today to head coach . Skorich received a three-year contract at a salary believed to be between $20,000 and $25,000 a year . He succeeds Buck Shaw , who retired at the end of last season . The appointment was announced at a news conference at which Skorich said he would retain two members of Shaw's staff -- Jerry Williams and Charlie Gauer . Williams is a defensive coach . Gauer works with the ends . Choice was expected The selection had been expected . Skorich was considered the logical choice after the club gave Norm Van Brocklin permission to seek the head coaching job with the Minnesota Vikings , the newest National Football League entry . Van Brocklin , the quarterback who led the Eagles to the title , was signed by the Vikings last Wednesday . Philadelphia permitted him to seek a better connection after he had refused to reconsider his decision to end his career as a player . With Skorich at the helm , the Eagles are expected to put more emphasis on running , rather than passing . In the past the club depended largely on Van Brocklin's aerials . Skorich , however , is a strong advocate of a balanced attack -- split between running and passing . Coach played 3 years Skorich , who is 39 years old , played football at Cincinnati University and then had a three-year professional career as a lineman under Jock Sutherland with the Pittsburgh Steelers . An injury forced Skorich to quit after the 1948 season . He began his coaching career at Pittsburgh Central Catholic High School in 1949 . He remained there for four years before moving to Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy , N. Y. . He was there one season before rejoining the Steelers as an assistant coach . Four years later he resigned to take a similar job with the Green Bay Packers . The Eagles signed him for Shaw's staff in 1959 . Skorich began his new job auspiciously today . At a ceremony in the reception room of Mayor Richardson Dilworth , the Eagles were honored for winning the championship . Shaw and Skorich headed a group of players , coaches and team officials who received an engrossed copy of an official city citation and a pair of silver cufflinks shaped like a football . With the announcement of a `` special achievement award '' to William A. ( ( Bill ) Shea , the awards list was completed yesterday for Sunday night's thirty-eighth annual dinner and show of the New York Chapter , Baseball Writers' Association of America , at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel . Shea , the chairman of Mayor Wagner's Baseball Committee , will be joined on the dais by Warren Spahn , the southpaw pitching ace of the Milwaukee Braves ; ; Frank Graham , the Journal-American sports columnist ; ; Bill Mazeroski , the World Series hero of the Pittsburgh Pirates , and Casey Stengel , the former manager of the Yankees . Stengel will receive the Ben Epstein Good Guy Award . Mazeroski , whose homer beat the Yankees in the final series game , will receive the Babe Ruth Award as the outstanding player in the 1960 world series . Graham will be recognized for his meritorious service to baseball and will get the William J. Slocum Memorial Award . To Spahn will go the Sid Mercer Memorial Award as the chapter's player of the year . Show follows ceremonies A crowd of 1,400 is expected for the ceremonies , which will be followed by the show in which the writers will lampoon baseball personalities in skit , dance and song . The 53-year-old Shea , a prominent corporation lawyer with a sports background , is generally recognized as the man most responsible for the imminent return of a National League club to New York . Named by Mayor Wagner three years ago to head a committee that included James A. Farley , Bernard Gimbel and Clint Blume , Shea worked relentlessly . His goal was to obtain a National League team for this city . The departure of the Giants and the Dodgers to California left New York with only the Yankees . Despite countless barriers and disappointments , Shea moved forward . When he was unable to bring about immediate expansion , he sought to convince another National League club to move here . When that failed , he enlisted Branch Rickey's aid in the formation of a third major league , the Continental , with New York as the key franchise . The Continental League never got off the ground , but after two years it forced the existing majors to expand . Flushing stadium in works The New York franchise is headed by Mrs. Charles Shipman Payson . A big-league municipal stadium at Flushing Meadow Park is in the works , and once the lease is signed the local club will be formally recognized by Commissioner Ford C. Frick . Shea's efforts figure prominently in the new stadium . Shea and his wife , Nori , make their home at Sands Point , L. I. . Bill Jr. , 20 , Kathy , 15 , and Patricia , 9 , round out the Shea family . Shea was born in Manhattan . He attended New York University before switching to Georgetown University in Washington . He played basketball there while working toward a law degree . Later , Shea owned and operated the Long Island Indians , a minor league professional football team . He was the lawyer for Ted Collins' old Boston Yankees in the National Football League . All was quiet in the office of the Yankees and the local National Leaguers yesterday . On Friday , Roger Maris , the Yankee outfielder and winner of the American League's most-valuable-player award , will meet with Roy Hamey , the general manager . Maris is in line for a big raise . Arnold Palmer and Sam Snead will be among those honored at the national awards dinner of the Metropolitan Golf Writers Association tonight . The dinner will be held at the Hotel Pierre . Palmer , golf's leading money-winner in 1960 , and Snead will be saluted as the winning team in the Canada Cup matches last June in Dublin . Deane Beman , the National Amateur champion , and all the metropolitan district champions , including Bob Gardner , the amateur title-holder , also will receive awards . The writers' Gold Tee Award will go to John McAuliffe of Plainfield , N. J. , and Palm Beach , Fla. , for his sponsorship of charity tournaments . Horton Smith of Detroit , a former president of the Professional Golfers Association , will receive the Ben Hogan Trophy for his comeback following a recent illness . The principal speaker will be Senator Stuart Symington , Democrat of Missouri . Golf's golden boy Arnold Palmer has been a blazing figure in golf over the past twelve months . He won the Masters , the United States Open and a record $80,738 in prize money . He was heralded as `` Sportsman of the Year '' by Sports Illustrated , and last night was acclaimed in Rochester as the `` Professional Athlete of the Year '' , a distinction that earned for him the $10,000 diamond-studded Hickok Belt . But he also achieved something that endeared him to every duffer who ever flubbed a shot . A couple of weeks ago , he scored a monstrous 12 on a par-5 hole . It made him human . And it also stayed the hands of thousands of brooding incompetents who were meditating the abandonment of a sport whose frustrations were driving them to despair . If such a paragon of perfection as Palmer could commit such a scoring sacrilege , there was hope left for all . It was neither a spirit of self-sacrifice nor a yen to encourage the downtrodden that motivated Arnold . He merely became victimized by a form of athletics that respects no one and aggravates all . The world's best golfer , shooting below par , came to the last hole of the opening round of the Los Angeles open with every intention of delivering a final crusher . He boomed a 280-yard drive . Then the pixies and the zombies took over while the banshees wailed in the distance . No margin for error On the narrow fairway of a 508-yard hole , Arnold whipped into his second shot . The ball went off in a majestic arc , an out-of-bounds slice . He tried again and once more sliced out of bounds . He hooked the next two out of bounds on the opposite side . `` It is possible that I over-corrected '' , he said ruefully . Each of the four wayward shots cost him two strokes . So he wound up with a dozen . `` It was a nice round figure , that 12 '' , he said as he headed for the clubhouse , not too much perturbed . From the standpoint of the army of duffers , however , this was easily the most heartening exhibition they had had since Ben Hogan fell upon evil ways during his heyday and scored an 11 in the Texas open . The idol of the hackers , of course , is Ray Ainsley , who achieved a 19 in the United States Open . Their secondary hero is another pro , Willie Chisholm , who drank his lunch during another Open and tried to blast his way out of a rock-strewn gully . Willie's partner was Long Jim Barnes , who tried to keep count . Stickler for rules `` How many is that , Jim '' ? ? Asked Willie at one stage of his excavation project . `` Thirteen '' , said Long Jim . `` Nae , man '' , said Willie , `` ye must be countin' the echoes '' . He had a 16 . Palmer's dozen were honestly earned . Nor were there any rules to save him . If there had been , he would have found a loophole , because Arnold is one golfer who knows the code as thoroughly as the man who wrote the book . This knowledge has come in handy , too . His first shot in the Open last year landed in a brook that flowed along the right side of the fairway . The ball floated downstream . A spectator picked up the ball and handed it to a small boy , who dropped this suddenly hot potato in a very playable lie . Arnold sent for Joe Dey , the executive secretary of the golf association . Joe naturally ruled that a ball be dropped from alongside the spot where it had originally entered the stream . `` I knew it all along '' , confessed Arnold with a grin , `` but I just happened to think how much nicer it would be to drop one way up there '' . For a serious young man who plays golf with a serious intensity , Palmer has such an inherent sense of humor that it relieves the strain and keeps his nerves from jangling like banjo strings . Yet he remains the fiercest of competitors . He'll even bull head-on into the rules when he is sure he's right . That's how he first won the Masters in 1958 . It happened on the twelfth hole , a 155-yarder . Arnold's iron shot from the tee burrowed into the bunker guarding the green , an embankment that had become soft and spongy from the rains , thereby bringing local rules into force . Ruling from on high `` I can remove the ball , can't I '' ? ? Asked Palmer of an official . `` No '' , said the official . `` You must play it where it lies '' . `` You're wrong '' , said Arnold , a man who knows the rules . `` I'll do as you say , but I'll also play a provisional ball and get a ruling '' . He scored a 4 for the embedded ball , a 3 with the provisional one . The golfing fathers ruled in his favor . So he picked up a stroke with the provisional ball and won the tournament by the margin of that stroke . Until a few weeks ago , however , Arnold Palmer was some god-like creature who had nothing in common with the duffers . But after that 12 at Los Angeles he became one of the boys , a bigger hero than he ever had been before . A formula to supply players for the new Minneapolis Vikings and the problem of increasing the 1961 schedule to fourteen games will be discussed by National Football League owners at a meeting at the Hotel Warwick today . Other items on the agenda during the meetings , which are expected to continue through Saturday , concern television , rules changes , professional football's hall of fame , players' benefits and constitutional amendments . The owners would like each club in the fourteen-team league to play a home-and-home series with teams in its division , plus two games against teams in the other division . However , this would require a lengthening of the season from thirteen to fourteen weeks . Pete Rozelle , the league commissioner , pointed out : `` We'll have the problem of baseball at one end and weather at the other '' . Nine of the league's teams play in baseball parks and therefore face an early-season conflict in dates .
