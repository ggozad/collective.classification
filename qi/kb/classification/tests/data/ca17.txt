Those qualities make Esther Marr a popular asset at the Salvation Army's Social Center at 1200 Larimer St. . The pert , gray-haired woman who came to Denver three years ago from Buffalo , N.Y. , is a `` civilian '' with the Army . Her position covers a number of daily tasks common to any social director . The job also covers a number of other items . `` Mom '' Marr , as the more than 80 men at the center call her , is the link that helps to bridge the gulf between alcoholics and the outside world and between parolees and society . Her day starts early , but no matter how many pressing letters there are to be written ( and during May , which is National Salvation Army Week , there are plenty ) , schedules to be made or problems to be solved , Mrs. Marr's office is always open and the welcome mat is out . Mrs. Marr is the first contact a Skid Row figure talks to after he decides he wants to pick himself up . She sees that there is a cup of steaming hot coffee awaiting him and the two chat informally as she presents the rules of the center and explains procedures . `` Usually at this point a man is withdrawn from society and one of my jobs is to see that he relearns to mingle with his fellow men '' , Mrs. Marr explained . The Denverite has worked out an entire program to achieve this using the facilities of the center . `` And I bum tickets to everything I can '' , she said . `` I've become the greatest beggar in the world '' . In addition to the tickets to the movies , sporting events and concerts , Mrs. Marr lines up candy and cookies because alcoholics require a lot of sweets to replace the sugar in their system . Mrs. Marr also has a number of parolees to `` mother '' , watching to see that they do not break their parole and that they also learn to readjust to society . By mid-June , millions of Americans will take to the road on vacation trips up and down and back and forth across this vast and lovely land . In another four weeks , with schools closed across the nation , the great all-American summer safari will be under way . By July 1 , six weeks from now , motel-keepers all over the nation will , by 6 p.m. , be switching on that bleak -- to motorists -- sign , `` No Vacancy '' . No matter how many Americans go abroad in summer , probably a hundred times as many gas up the family car , throw suitcases , kids and comic books in the back seat , and head for home . And where is `` home '' , that magic place of the heart ? ? Ah , that is simple . Home is where a man was born , reared , went to school and , most particularly , where grandma is . That is where we turn in the good old summertime . The land lies ready for the coming onslaught . My husband and I , a month ahead of the rush , have just finished a 7-day motor journey of 2809 miles from Tucson , Ariz. , to New York City : set for influx I can testify that motels , service and comfort stations ( they go together like Scots and heather ) , dog wagons , roadside restaurants , souvenir stands and snake farms are braced and waiting . I hope it can be said without boasting that no other nation offers its vacationing motorists such variety and beauty of scene , such an excellent network of roads on which to enjoy it and such decent , far-flung over-night accommodations . Maybe motel-keeping isn't the nation's biggest industry , but it certainly looks that way from the highway . There are motels for all purposes and all tastes . There are even motels for local weather peculiarities in Shamrock , Tex. , as I discovered . There the Royal Motel advertises `` all facilities , vented heat , air conditioned , carpeted , free TV , storm cellar '' . Many with pools Innumerable motels from Tucson to New York boast swimming pools ( `` swim at your own risk '' is the hospitable sign poised at the brink of most pools ) . Some even boast two pools , one for adults and one for children . But the Royal Motel in Shamrock was the only one that offered the comfort and security of a storm cellar . Motorists like myself who can remember the old `` tourists accommodated '' signs on farm houses and village homes before World War 2 , can only marvel at the great size and the luxury of the relatively new and fast-grossing motel business . All for $14 ! ! At the Boxwood Motel in Winchester , Va. , we accidentally drew the honeymoon suite , an elegant affair with wall-to-wall carpeting , gold and white furniture , pink satin brocade chairs , 24-inch TV and a pink tile bath with masses of pink towels . All for $14 . That made up for the `` best '' motel in Norman , Okla. , where the proprietor knocked $2 off the $8.50 tab when we found ants in the pressed-paper furniture . Oxnard , Calif. , will be the home of the Rev. Robert D. Howard and his bride , the former Miss Judith Ellen Gay , who were married Saturday at the Munger Place Methodist Church . Parents of the bride are Mr. and Mrs. Ferris M. Gay , 7034 Coronado . The bridegroom is the son of Mrs. James Baines of Los Angeles , Calif. , and Carl E. Howard of Santa Monica , Calif. . He is a graduate of UCLA and Perkins School of Theology , Aj . Dr. W. B. I. Martin officiated , and the bride was given in marriage by her father .

Miss Joan Frances Baker , a graduate of SMU , was married Saturday to Elvis Leonard Mason , an honor graduate of Lamar State College of Technology , in the chapel of the First Presbyterian Church of Houston . The bride , daughter of Rhodes Semmes Baker Jr. of Houston and the late Mrs. Baker , was president of Kappa Kappa Gamma and a member of Mortar Board at Aj . Her husband , who is the son of Alton John Mason of Shreveport , La. , and the late Mrs. Henry Cater Parmer , was president of Alpha Tau Omega and a member of Delta Sigma Pi at Lamar Tech , and did graduate work at Rhodes University in Grahamstown , South Africa , on a Rotary Fellowship . The Rev. Richard Freeman of Texas City officiated and Charles Pabor and Mrs. Marvin Hand presented music . The bride was given in marriage by her father . She wore a court-length gown of organdy designed with bateau neckline and princesse skirt accented by lace appliques . Her veil was caught to a crown , and she carried gardenias and stephanotis . Miss Mary Ross of Baird was maid of honor , and bridesmaids were Miss Pat Dawson of Austin , Mrs. Howard M. Dean of Hinsdale , Ill. , and Mrs. James A. Reeder of Shreveport , La. . Cecil Mason of Hartford , Conn. , was best man for his brother , and groomsmen were Rhodes S. Baker 3 , of Houston , Dr. James Carter of Houston and Conrad McEachern of New Orleans , La. . Lee Jackson and Ken Smith , both of Houston , and Alfred Neumann of Beaumont seated guests . After a reception at The Mayfair , the newlyweds left for a wedding trip to New Orleans , La. . They will live in Corpus Christi . Miss Shirley Joan Meredith , a former student of North Texas State University , was married Saturday to Larry W. Mills , who has attended Arlington State College . They will live at 2705 Fitzhugh after a wedding trip to Corpus Christi . Parents of the couple are Ray Meredith of Denton and the late Mrs. Meredith and Mrs. Hardy P. Mills of Floresville and the late Mr. Mills . The Rev. Melvin Carter officiated at the ceremony in Slaughter Chapel of the First Baptist Church . Dan Beam presented music and the bride was given in marriage by her father . She wore a gown of satin designed along princesse lines and featuring a flared skirt and lace jacket with bateau neckline . Her veil was caught to a pearl headdress , and she carried stephanotis and orchids . Miss Glenda Kay Meredith of Denton was her sister's maid of honor , and Vernon Lewelleyn of San Angelo was best man . Robert Lovelace and Cedric Burgher Jr. seated guests .
