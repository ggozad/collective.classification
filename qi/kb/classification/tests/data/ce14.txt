( Do start fires one or two hours ahead of time to obtain a lasting bed of glowing coals . Keep ashes from one barbecue to the next to sprinkle over coals if they are too hot , and to stop flames that arise from melting grease . Do line barbecue fire bowl with heavy foil to reflect heat . Don't forget to buy a plastic pastry brush for basting with sauces . Clean it meticulously in boiling water and detergent , rinse thoroughly . Do build a wall of glowing coals six to eight inches in front of meat that is barbecued on an electric spit . Make use of the back of the barbecue or of the hood for heating vegetables , sauces and such . Don't fail to shorten cooking time by the use of aluminum foil cut slightly larger than the surface of steaks and chops . Sear on both sides then cover meat loosely with heat reflecting foil for juiciest results . Do avoid puncturing or cutting into meats to test them . If doubtful about a steak , boldly cut it in half . If necessary to replace both halves on grill , sear cuts and allot extra time . For roasts , insert meat thermometer diagonally so it does not rest on bone . Also make sure thermometer does not touch the revolving spit or hit the coals . Don't practice a new recipe on guests . Have a test-run on the family first , to be sure timing and seasoning are right . Do buy meat the day or the day before you intend to cook it . Keep it no longer than 36 hours before cooking , and keep it in the coldest ( but non-freezing ) compartment of the refrigerator . Don't plan meals that are too complicated . Limit yourself to good meat and drink , with bread , salad , corn or potatoes as accessories . Keep the desserts simple ; ; fruit does nicely . Do whatever kitchen work , such as fixing a salad , preparing garlic bread , or making a marinade sauce , ahead of time . When you start the outdoor performance , you can stay outdoors without a dozen running trips into the kitchen . ( This goes for getting a drink tray ready , and for having a big cooler full of ice on hand long before the party begins . ) Don't think you have to start with the most expensive equipment in the world . The simplest grill ( pan type ) or inexpensive hibachi can make you a chef . You need tongs to handle meat ; ; long forks for turning potatoes and corn ; ; heavy foil on hand at all times . And lots of hot pads ! ! Do keep the grill high enough above the fire so that when fat from meat drips down and flares up , flames cannot reach the meat . Don't forget to have a supply of Melamine plates , bowls , cups , saucers , and platters for outdoor use . Made of the world's toughest unbreakable plastic , Melamine dinnerware comes in almost 400 different patterns and dozens of colors . There is even one set that has `` barbecue '' written on it . Do without fancy tablecloths . It's cheaper to buy Wall-Tex and cover your outdoor table . Or buy half a dozen lengths of oilcloth and change patterns for different kinds of barbecues . Oilcloth only costs about 79-cents a yard for the very best . Tougher than plastic , it wears well . Don't forget -- when you take to the hills or the beach -- that your cooler , which you might have used for wine- or beer-cooling on your terrace or back yard , is indispensable for carrying liquid refreshments . There are many varieties of coolers and they serve many purposes . With them , you can carry steaks and hamburgers at refrigerator temperatures , and also get your frozen food for stews and chowders , to the marina or picnic , in A-1 condition . Do use paper napkins ; ; lots of them . Except when you prepare `` do it yourself '' shish kebob or a lobster roast . Then you'll want terry cloth towels for mopping up . Don't think barbecue cooking is just sometimes , or seasonal . It's year-round , and everywhere . In the winter , hibachi in the kitchen or grill over the logs of the fireplace . Even use your portable electric or gas grill in the winter , inside . Summertime supper , outside , is a natural . You'll find , once your technique is perfected , that you can cook on a boat with a simple Bernz-O-Matic . Do buy all-purpose mugs or cups . Get copper or earthenware mugs that keep beer chilled or soup hot . Be sure to get a few more than you need . You will discover you keep the sauce for basting meat in one , use six for drinks , serve soup or coffee in another half-dozen -- and need one more to mix the salad dressing . Don't forget the joys of a meal on the road . If you travel over the vast U.S.A. you will , no doubt , discover that feeding is an expensive business . Decide in the beginning to put your barbecue equipment to work . You can take it with you . A picnic bag , a grill , a cooler for soft drinks and beer , and for frozen convenience foods . Eat in a restaurant or motel mornings and evenings ; ; or just evenings . Turn off at any one of the marked picnic areas ( gasoline companies have touring service bureaus that issue booklets on national parks to tell you where you have barbecue facilities ) and -- with soft drinks cooled from morning loading up , hamburger , buns , an array of relishes , and fresh fruit -- your lunch is 75% cheaper than at a restaurant , and 100% more fun . You need a little stove , a coffee pot and a stew pot ; ; maybe a skillet , a basket of essentials like salt , pepper , plates , forks , knives and a can opener . As you pull out of your motel or national park home-for-the-night , visit a market and buy just what you need for the next meal . For 25-cents load up the cooler with ice and keep cool pop in the car . Simple meat dishes spice is a fact of life in the U.S.A. . You only have to think of franks and sausages to know what I mean . Go a step further and list all the wonderful barbecue basics -- cervelat , salami , Vienna sausages , mettwurst , bratwurst , bockwurst , knackwurst , Bologna , pepperoni , blutwurst -- and you have a long list of easy specialties . Threaded on a skewer with new boiled potatoes , a bit of green pepper , a fresh white mushroom -- any one of these spiced meats makes a man a cook , and a meal a feast . Sure , for the most of us , a frankfurter is the favorite . A story goes that a certain Herr Feuchtwanger of St. Louis , around 1883 served his sausages ( grilled ) and mustard to his fancy customers . So that his customers should not soil their hands , Feuchtwanger issued white gloves . Discovery that the gloves frequently left with the customers made the wise peddler of spiced sausage-meat come upon a compromise . He had a bakery make buns sized to fit his franks . Years later , franks-in-buns were accepted as the `` first to go '' at the New York Polo Grounds . The nation's number one picnic treat is the skinless frankfurter -- toasted over a bonfire on the beach or , more sedately , charcoal broiled on a portable grill . Either way it's hard to beat in flavor as well as ease of preparation . To make the picnic frank come close to perfection , remember these tips : -- Score each frankfurter in four or five places about a third of the way through . This permits the juices to permeate the meat during cooking . -- Relishes are as vital to the success of the frank as are buns . Bring along the conventional ones -- catsup , pickle relish , mustard , mayonnaise -- plus a few extras , such as tangy barbecue sauce , chive cream cheese , or horse-radish for the brave ones in the crowd . -- Using a portable grill permits you to toast the buns , too . Watch closely while browning them , as it doesn't take long . -- An unusual flavor can be achieved by marinating the franks in French dressing or a mixture of honey , lemon juice and brown sugar prior to the picnic . Broil or toast as usual . Contrary to popular opinion , `` a la mode '' doesn't mean `` with ice cream '' -- it just means , in the latest style . Here are a couple of the latest , highly styled ways to fix skinless franks in your own back yard ! ! You'll have the neighbor's eyes popping as well as their mouths watering ! ! Jiffy barbecues 1 cup chili sauce 1/3 cup water 1 tablespoon barbecue sauce 2 teaspoons prepared mustard 1/2 pound chipped , spiced ham 6 sandwich buns , heated .

Hot hibachi franks You'll never hear `` sayonara '' , the Japanese word for goodbye , from your guests when you give a hibachi party . The fun of toasting their own sausages over the small Oriental charcoal burners and dipping them in tasty sauces will keep your group busy -- try it and see ! ! Canned cocktail frankfurters sweet-sour sauce 1 large onion , chopped fine 2 tablespoons salad oil 1 8-oz. can crushed pineapple and 1/2 cup of the juice 1/4 cup brown sugar 2 tablespoons vinegar 1 tablespoon prepared mustard 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce pineapple chunks . Mustard cream 2 tablespoons dry mustard Water 1/2 cup heavy cream , whipped Salt Paprika . Spear canned cocktail franks with picks . Also spear pineapple chunks and place in separate bowl . Make sauces ahead . Sweet-sour sauce can be kept warm over a second hibachi or chafing dish while charcoal in broiler is reaching glowing coal stage . Mustard cream , used as alternate dip for franks and pineapple tidbits , tastes best when served at room temperature . For sweet-sour sauce , cook onion in oil until soft . Add remaining ingredients and bring to a boil . Simmer about 10 minutes , and keep warm for serving . To prepare mustard cream , blend mustard with enough water to make a thin paste . Fold into whipped cream and add a dash of salt and sprinkling of paprika .
