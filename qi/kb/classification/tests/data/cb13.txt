Sizzling temperatures and hot summer pavements are anything but kind to the feet . That is why it is important to invest in comfortable , airy types of shoes . There are many soft and light shoe leathers available . Many styles have perforations and an almost weightlessness achieved via unlined leathers . Softness is found in crushed textures . Styles run the gamut from slender and tapered with elongated toes to a newer squared toe shape . Heels place emphasis on the long legged silhouette . Wine glass heels are to be found in both high and semi-heights . Stacked heels are also popular on dressy or tailored shoes . Just the barest suggestion of a heel is found on teenage pumps . Coolest shade While white is the coolest summer shade , there are lots of pastel hues along with tintable fabrics that will blend with any wardrobe color . In the tintable group are high and little heels , squared and oval throats , and shantung-like textures . Don't overlook the straws this year . They come in crisp basket weaves in natural honey hues , along with lacey open weaves with a lustre finish in natural , white , black and a whole range of colors . In the casual field straws feature wedge heels of cork or carved wood in a variety of styles . For added comfort some of the Italian designed sandals have foam padded cushioning . The citrus tones popular in clothing are also to be found afoot . Orange and lemon are considered important as are such pastels as blue and lilac . In a brighter nautical vein is Ille De France blue . Contrast trim provides other touches of color . Spectators in white crush textures dip toe and heel in smooth black , navy and taffy tan . Designed for ease Designed for summer comfort are the shoes illustrated . At the left is a pair of dressy straw pumps in a light , but crisp texture . In a lacey open weave shoes have a luster finish , braided collar and bow highlight on the squared throat . At right is a casual style in a crushed unlined white leather . Flats have a scalloped throat . An electric toothbrush ( Broxodent ) may soon take its place next to the electric razor in the American bathroom . The brush moves up and down and is small enough to clean every dental surface , including the back of the teeth . In addition , the motor has the seal of approval of the Underwriters Laboratories , which means it is safe . The unit consists of a small motor that goes on as soon as it is plugged in . The speed is controlled by pressing on the two brake buttons located where the index finger and thumb are placed when holding the motor . The brushes can be cleaned and sterilized by boiling and are detachable so that every member of the family can have his own . Most of us brush our teeth by hand . The same can be said of shaving yet the electric razor has proved useful to many men . The electric toothbrush moves in a vertical direction , the way dentists recommend . In addition , it is small enough to get into crevices , jacket and crown margins , malposed anteriors , and the back teeth . The bristles are soft enough to massage the gums and not scratch the enamel . It is conceivable that Broxodent could do a better job than ordinary brushing , especially in those who do not brush their teeth properly . Several dentists and patients with special dental problems have experimented with the device . The results were good although they are difficult to compare with hand brushing , particularly when the individual knows how to brush his teeth properly . The electric gadget is most helpful when there are many crowned teeth and in individuals who are elderly , bedfast with a chronic disease , or are handicapped by disorders such as cerebral palsy or muscular dystrophy . But for many of us , it will prove an enjoyable luxury . It is not as convenient as the old type toothbrush and the paste tends to shimmy off the bristles . Since the apparatus is new , it requires experimentation and changes in technique . Turn over writes : Does numbness in the left hand at night , which awakens the person , indicate brain tumor ? ? Reply : no . This is a common symptom and the cause usually is pressure on the nerve leading to the affected hand . The pressure may come from muscles , tendons , or bones anywhere from the neck to the hand . Steam baths writes : Do steam baths have any health value ? ? Reply : No , other than cleaning out the pores and making the sweat glands work harder . An ordinary hot bath or shower will do the same . Sewing brings numbness writes : What makes my hands numb when sewing ? ? Reply : There are many possibilities , including poor circulation , a variety of neurological conditions , and functional disorders . This manifestation may be an early sign of multiple sclerosis or the beginning of sewer's cramp . Brace for sciatica writes : Does a brace help in sciatica ? ? Reply : A back brace might help , depending upon the cause of sciatica . Cholesterol and thyroid writes : Does the cholesterol go down when most of the thyroid gland is removed ? ? Reply : no . It usually goes up . The cholesterol level in the blood is influenced by the glands of the body . It is low when the thyroid is overactive and high when the gland is sluggish . The latter is likely to occur when the thyroid is removed . The gap between the bookshelf and the record cabinet grows smaller with each new recording catalogue . There's more reading and instruction to be heard on discs than ever before , although the spoken rather than the sung word is as old as Thomas Alva Edison's first experiment in recorded sound . Edison could hardly have guessed , however , that Sophocles would one day appear in stereo . If the record buyer's tastes are somewhat eclectic or even the slightest bit esoteric , he will find them satisfied on educational records . And he will avoid eye-strain in the process . Everything from poetry to phonetics , history to histrionics , philosophy to party games has been adapted to the turntable . For sheer ambition , take the Decca series titled modestly `` Wisdom '' . Volumes One and Two , selected from the sound tracks of a television series , contain `` conversations with the elder wise men of our day '' . These sages include poet Carl Sandburg , statesman Jawaharlal Nehru and sculptor Jacques Lipchitz , in Volume One , and playwright Sean O'Casey , David Ben-Gurion , philosopher Bertrand Russell and the late Frank Lloyd Wright in the second set . Hugh Downs is heard interviewing Wright , for an added prestige fillip . There's more specialization and a narrower purpose in two albums recently issued by Dover Publications . Dover `` publishes '' what the company calls `` Listen And Learn '' Productions designed to teach foreign languages . Previous presentations have been on French , Spanish , Russian , Italian , German and Japanese . But the firm has recognized the tight dollar and the tourist's desire to visit the `` smaller , less-traveled and relatively inexpensive countries '' , and is now prepared to teach modern Greek and Portuguese through recordings . The respective vocabularies `` essential for travel '' are available in separate albums . Thanks to Spoken Arts Records , history buffs may hear Lincoln's `` most memorable speeches and letters '' in a two-disc set , interpreted by Lincoln authority and lecturer Roy P. Basler . As a contemporary bonus , the set includes Carl Sandburg's address at a joint session of Congress , delivered on Lincoln's birthday two years ago . For those who `` like poetry but never get around to reading it '' , the Library of Congress makes it possible for poets to be heard reading their own work . The program was instituted in 1940 , and releases are available only from the Recording Laboratory of the Library of Congress , Washington 25 , D.C. . A catalogue is available on request . Newest on the list are John Ciardi , W. D. Snodgrass , I. A. Richards , Oscar Williams , Robert Hillyer , John Hall Wheelock , Stephen Vincent Benet , Edwin Muir , John Peal Bishop and Maxwell Bodenheim . Two poets are paired on each record , in the order given above . Decca is not the only large commercial company to impart instruction . RCA Victor has an ambitious and useful project in a stereo series called `` Adventures In Music '' , which is an instructional record library for elementary schools . Howard Mitchell and the National Symphony perform in the first two releases , designed for grades one and two . Teaching guides are included with each record . In an effort to fortify himself against the unforseen upsets sure to arise in the future , Herbert A. Leggett , banker-editor of the Phoenix `` Arizona Progress '' , reflects upon a few of the depressing experiences of the feverish fifties . One of the roughest was the TV quiz shows , which gave him inferiority complexes . Though it was a great relief when the big brains on these shows turned out to be frauds and phonies , it did irreparable damage to the ego of the editor and many another intelligent , well-informed American . But the one that upset the financially wise was the professional dancer who related in a book how he parlayed his earnings into a $2,000,000 profit on the stock market . Every man who dabbles in the market to make a little easy money on the side and suffers losses could at the time hardly face his wife who was wondering how her husband could be so dumb . Investors breathed more freely when it was learned that this acrobatic dancer had turned magician and was only doing a best seller book to make some dough . People who take us for suckers are like the Westerner who had on exhibit his superior marksmanship in the form of a number of bull's-eye achievements . The promoter who wanted to sign him up for the circus asked him how he was able to do it . His answer was simple but honest . He just shot at the board and then drew circles around the holes to form a bull's-eye . One of the obstacles to the easy control of a 2-year-old child is a lack of verbal communication . The child understands no . He senses his mother's disapproval . But explanations leave him confused and unmoved . If his mother loves him , he clings to that love as a ballast . It motivates his behavior . He wants Mommy to think him a good boy . He doesn't want her to look frowningly at him , or speak to him angrily . This breaks his heart . He wants to be called sweet , good , considerate and mother's little helper . But even mother's loving attitude will not always prevent misbehavior . His desires are so strong that he needs constant reassurance of his mother's love for him and what she expects of him , in order to overcome them . His own inner voice , which should tell him what not to do , has not developed . It won't develop until he has words with which to clothe it . The conscience is non-existent in the 2-year-old . What can a mother do then to prevent misbehavior ? ? She can decrease the number of temptations . She can remove all knick-knacks within reach . The fewer nos she has to utter the more effective they will be . She should offer substitutes for the temptations which seem overwhelmingly desirable to the child . If he can't play with Mommy's magazines , he should have some old numbers of his own . If Daddy's books are out of bounds his own picture books are not . Toys he has can be made to act as substitutes for family temptations such as refrigerator and gas stove . During this precarious period of development the mother should continue to influence the growth of the child's conscience . She tells him of the consequences of his behavior . If he bites a playmate she says , `` Danny won't like you '' . If he snatches a toy , she says , `` Caroline wants her own truck just as you do '' . There is no use trying to `` Explain '' to a 2-year-old . Actions speak louder . Remove temptations . Remove the child from the scene of his misbehavior . Substitute approved objects for forbidden ones and keep telling him how he is to act . He won't submit to his natural desires all the time , and it's Mother's love that is responsible for his good behavior .
