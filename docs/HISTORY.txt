Changelog
=========
0.1b1
-------------------
- Speed gain by not utilizing the PenTreeBank tagger anymore. [ggozad]
- Added multi-lingual support, starting with dutch! [ggozad]
- No need to download all the coprora anymore. [ggozad]
- A lot of refactoring. Things got moved around and a lot of unnecessary code
was removed. [ggozad]
- We now use a Brill/Trigram/Affix tagger that is pre-trained. This
allows collective.classification to ship without all the corpora. The user
can still supply a different tagger if necessary. [ggozad]
